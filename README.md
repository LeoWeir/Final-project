The True Cost of Daylight Saving Time
Overview
This project explores how Daylight Saving Time (DST) affects people’s health, safety, and behavior. I looked at anxiety, depression, accident rates, and spending. My goal was to understand if this time change still helps—or if it's causing more harm than good.

Why I Chose This Topic
I’ve always found DST frustrating. It messes with my sleep. It adds stress for no clear reason. Most of my clocks need to be reset twice a year. The one in my car is only right for half of it.

Some states don’t follow DST. That made me curious. I’ve also traveled a lot, and nobody talks about DST. I wanted to find out who still uses it and why.

This project helped me ask a big question: Does DST help, or should we stop doing it?

What I Wanted to Know
Does DST lead to more hospital visits?

Are there more fatal car accidents after the clock changes?

Does sleep disruption explain mental health spikes?

Are certain age groups more affected than others?

Does DST cause us to spend more money?

What I Found
Mental health distress rises 25% during DST.

Young adults (18–29) have the worst symptoms.

Depression and anxiety spike most in March and November.

DST months have 15% higher spending on things like food, salons, and hobbies.

Fatal car crashes go up 6% the Monday after “spring forward.”

States without DST (like Arizona and Hawaii) don’t have the same spikes.

What I Built
Bar charts showing anxiety and depression across months and age groups

Stacked bar graphs comparing DST vs. non-DST spending

Crash data from before and after DST changes

A slide deck to explain it to everyday people and decision-makers

Tools I Used
SQL

Python

Power BI

Data from CDC, HCUP, BLS, and FARS crash reports

Challenges
Some data was hard to access. Health data had privacy limits. Spending and crash data wasn’t always labeled by exact date. I worked around this by focusing on clear time windows before and after DST.

I also had to simplify the visuals. I wanted each chart to show something new without repeating myself.

Who This Is For
This project is for people who feel off during DST and want to know why. It’s also for local leaders and students who care about how small changes can cause big problems.

Final Thought
Daylight Saving Time affects how we feel, spend, and stay safe. One hour of change does a lot more damage than most people realize.
