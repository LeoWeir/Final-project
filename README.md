# 🕒 The True Cost of Daylight Saving Time

## 📌 Overview
This project explores how Daylight Saving Time (DST) affects people’s health, safety, and behavior.  
I looked at anxiety, depression, accident rates, and spending.  
My goal was to understand if this time change still helps—or if it's causing more harm than good.

## 💡 Why I Chose This Topic
I’ve always found DST frustrating. It messes with my sleep. It adds stress for no clear reason.  
Most of my clocks need to be reset twice a year. The one in my car is only right for half of it.

Some states don’t follow DST. That made me curious. I’ve also traveled a lot, and nobody talks about DST.  
I wanted to find out who still uses it and why.

This project helped me ask a big question: **Does DST help, or should we stop doing it?**

## ❓ What I Wanted to Know
- Does DST lead to more hospital visits?  
- Are there more fatal car accidents after the clock changes?  
- Does sleep disruption explain mental health spikes?  
- Are certain age groups more affected than others?  
- Does DST cause us to spend more money?

## 🔍 What I Found
- Mental health distress rises **25%** during DST  
- Young adults (18–29) have the worst symptoms  
- Depression and anxiety spike most in **March** and **November**  
- DST months have **15% higher spending** on food, salons, and hobbies  
- Fatal car crashes go up **6%** the Monday after “spring forward”  
- States without DST (like Arizona and Hawaii) don’t have the same spikes

## 🛠️ What I Built
- 📊 Bar charts showing anxiety and depression across months and age groups  
- 📉 Stacked bar graphs comparing DST vs. non-DST spending  
- 🚗 Crash data from before and after DST changes  
- 🖥️ A slide deck to explain findings to everyday people and decision-makers
